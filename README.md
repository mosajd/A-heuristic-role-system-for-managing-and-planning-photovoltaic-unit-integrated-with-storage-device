<h1>A heuristic role system for managing and planning photovoltaic unit integrated with storage device</h1>
<p>This is one of the homework for the <a href='http://www.itim.unige.it/cs/strategos/edu/strategos_course_strategy_for_energy.pdf'>'Strategies for Energy'</a> ourse from the prestigious master program of <a href='http://www.itim.unige.it/cs/strategos/'>'Engineering Technology for Strategy and Security - Strategos'</a> at the <a href='https://unige.it/en'>University of Genova</a>.</p>
<p>The problem has given the electrical load request as well as the PV power production per kW peak installed in four typical days, one per season in the attached excel file.</p>
<p>It also provides the technical configuration of desirable PV and Storag Device to equip an industry.</p>
<p>The aim is the implementation of a heuristic method to chose the optimal sizing of a Photovoltaic (PV) unit and a Storage (ST) device to fulfill the electrical demand of industry and gain the maximum benefits by selling the electricity to the grid.</p>
<p>To do this, I chose a <b>brute force algorithm</b> instead of the <b>heuristic method</b>, becuase the search space is small enough for the required compution power.
In general, heuristic reduces the search space and they canâ€™t be one and the same, but they can be used in combination in this situation.</p>
